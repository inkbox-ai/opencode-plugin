# Inkbox SMS responder

The Inkbox plugin gives this agent a working phone number under an agent identity. Use this skill whenever the user asks you to check, triage, or reply to SMS or MMS conversations, including group chats — short, conversational, opt-in-gated.

## Tools

Enabled by default:

- `inkbox_list_text_conversations` — start here for triage; includes group chats and returns conversation IDs
- `inkbox_get_text_conversation` — pull message history by `conversationId` or legacy `remotePhoneNumber`
- `inkbox_send_sms` — outbound by `conversationId`, one E.164 recipient, or a 2-8 recipient group

Opt-in — the user must enable these in opencode.json, then restart opencode:

- `inkbox_list_texts`, `inkbox_get_text` — low-level access to individual messages
- `inkbox_mark_text_read`, `inkbox_mark_text_conversation_read` — clear unread state

```json
"plugin": [["@inkbox/opencode-plugin", { "tools": { "enable": ["inkbox_mark_text_conversation_read"] } }]]
```

(Enabling the `"sms"` group turns all four on at once.) `inkbox_doctor` reports which tools are currently enabled or disabled.

## Workflow

1. **Pull conversations.** Call `inkbox_list_text_conversations` (defaults: `limit: 25`, newest-updated first, groups included). Each row shows `id`, `participants`, `isGroup`, `remotePhoneNumber` for 1:1, `latestText`, `unreadCount`, `totalCount`.

2. **Pick a conversation to handle.** Read the latest text in the row. If you need history, call `inkbox_get_text_conversation` with `conversationId: row.id` and a reasonable `limit` (50 is fine). Use `remotePhoneNumber` only for old 1:1 rows that do not have an ID.

3. **Compose and send.** Prefer `inkbox_send_sms` with `conversationId` when replying to an existing conversation, especially a group. For a new text, pass `to` as one E.164 number or a list of 2-8 E.164 numbers. Keep the tone conversational — SMS isn't email. Sends prompt for approval through opencode's permission system by default; the `outbound.allowedRecipients` and `outbound.approval` (`"ask"` | `"allowlist"` | `"auto"`) plugin options control this.

4. **Mark as handled** if `inkbox_mark_text_conversation_read` is enabled: pass `conversationId`.

## Calling someone on SMS

If someone in an SMS conversation should get a call, place it from your **dedicated phone line** — the same number the conversation is on — with `inkbox_place_call` and `origination: "dedicated_number"`. Set it explicitly. (The shared iMessage line is only for people connected over iMessage.)

`inkbox_place_call` is opt-in (enable it — or the `"calls"` group — the same way as above). It takes `toNumber`, `origination`, and optionally `clientWebsocketUrl`; every call needs a call WebSocket (an audio bridge Inkbox connects to), supplied per call via `clientWebsocketUrl` or via the `callWebsocketUrl` plugin option / `INKBOX_CALL_WEBSOCKET_URL`.

## Gates and errors

- **Opt-in required.** Recipients must have texted `START` to one of your Inkbox numbers. If they haven't, `inkbox_send_sms` returns the plain-language error "Recipient has not opted in to SMS." Surface this to the user; do not try to bypass.
- **Opt-out is final.** If a recipient texted `STOP`, sending returns "Recipient has opted out of SMS." Do not attempt to message them again on the same number.
- **Carrier propagation window.** Newly provisioned local numbers take ~10–15 min to propagate to carriers. During this window, sends return "Your Inkbox phone number is still propagating to carriers." Wait it out; don't retry tight-loop.
- **Toll-free numbers cannot send SMS** today. If the identity's phone is toll-free, sends will fail — recommend the user provision a local number instead.
- **Rate cap.** Roughly 15 outbound sends per number per 24h. The plugin surfaces this as a 409. Pause sending and wait.
- **Group chats.** When triaging a group, reply only to messages that clearly address this agent or ask it to act. Do not comment on every group message — if nothing warrants a reply, skip the thread and report that to the user.

## SMS-specific style

- Short. Often a single sentence is right.
- Don't include subject lines, signatures, or links unless explicitly asked.
- One thought per message; if it needs multiple parts, send them as separate messages rather than a 1600-char wall.

## What this skill does NOT cover

- Provisioning phone numbers (done outside this plugin, e.g. via the Inkbox dashboard or CLI).
- Org-level SMS opt-in registry writes (admin-only, customer-managed 10DLC campaigns only).
- Creating a group with more than 8 recipients; carrier group MMS caps are lower than email-style threads.

## When you need more — raw Inkbox docs

If something here doesn't match what you're seeing, or you need API behavior this skill doesn't describe (field names, error codes, edge cases), go to the source:

- **https://inkbox.ai/llms.txt** — LLM-friendly index of every Inkbox doc page.
- **https://inkbox.ai/docs/all.md** — the full Inkbox documentation concatenated as one markdown file.

Prefer fetching these over guessing.
